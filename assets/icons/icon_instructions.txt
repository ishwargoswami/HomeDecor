To complete the app icon update, please follow these steps:

1. Create a square PNG image (1024x1024 pixels) with a home decoration theme
2. Save it as "home_decor_icon.png" in this directory (assets/icons/)
3. The icon should use the app's color theme:
   - Light sage background: #DAD7CD
   - Home icon in hunter green: #3A5A40
   - Decoration elements in fern green: #588157

4. Run the following command to generate app icons:
   flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons

This will update the app icon across Android, iOS, and web platforms to match the new DecorHome branding.
